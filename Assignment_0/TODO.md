# TODOs

## Lab Assignment
Broad topics to cover - 
* Vectorization in numpy (Can be done by comparing runtimes of for loop and vectorized code)
* Converting equations into numpy functions (can be combined with above point
* Plotting with different scales?
* Some probability or lin-alg thing?

## Theory Assignment
* Have some recap of linear algebra and probability. We can potentially use problems from last year.
